# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's mill coverage and crew intake process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for weaver/mill records.
3. Run synthetic operating cases (work-log entry, crew-operation
   scheduling, supply coordination, safety-concern flagging).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical`
   actions (all flagged safety concerns, above-threshold supply
   orders).
5. Measure operating outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (entanglement hazard, noise
  exposure, equipment condition)
- provenance for all operating records (weaver and mill both
  independently registered)
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions
- a hard, unconditional block on any attempt to route a
  machine-operation-execution decision, a mill-safety-clearance
  decision, or a mill-safety-officer-override decision, through this
  actor — those decisions stay the mill safety officer's exclusive
  authority end to end

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans, and that no deployment configuration can route a
machine-operation-execution decision, a mill-safety-clearance
decision, or a mill-safety-officer judgment override through this
actor.
